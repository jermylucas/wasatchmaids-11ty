## Who are we?

We are Wasatch Maids, a top rated cleaning service based out of Ogden, but serving areas from Kaysville to Willard, and from Hooper to Mountain Green. We have a small team of employees which allows us to keep quality control at the best possible level. All of our cleaners are certified, experienced cleaners, and only use the safest and most effective products, and in a way that is safest for your home.

## Why start a blog?

We have been cleaning for a long time, but decided to start a blog in order to talk about various cleaning strategies, talk a little bit more about us and our team, and have an opportunity to talk about what's going on in the area. Sometimes we'll have posts about the best cleaning supplies for a specific item or area of your home, and other times we may share the best food in the Ogden-Clearfield metro area.

Long story short, we want to share some things that matter to us, that will be valuable to you, and we hope this little corner of the internet provides some sort of value.

## Where else can you find us?

While we don't use social media very often, we can occasionally be found on [Facebook](https://facebook.com/wasatchmaids) and [Instagram](https://instagram.com/wasatchmaids). If you ever need to get in touch with us outside of social media, we are easily accessible by text at [801.821.2316](sms:8018212316) and email at [contact@wasatchmaids.com](mailto:contact@wasatchmaids.com).
