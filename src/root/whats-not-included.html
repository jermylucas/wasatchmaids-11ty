        <p>
          If an item is on this list, it's because of insurance coverage, worker
          safety, or that we simply don't have the equipment to clean it. We
          will always do our best to help, so if you need something that's
          listed below, please reach out!
        </p>
        <p>
          For matters of safety, we may need to stop the service until matters
          are taken care of.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note: The cleaning type determines the nature of things we can or
          cannot clean (for example, we don't clean paint on a standard clean,
          but we can do this during a construction clean or at an additional
          charge). If you have any questions, give us a call.
        </p>
        <h3>Our Satisfaction Guarantee</h3>
        <p>
          Your Satisfaction is guaranteed. While we do not offer refunds on
          services that have been completed, we will return & re-clean any areas
          of concern that are reported to us within 24 hours of your cleaning.
          We want this to be a help for you, and we will do everything we can to
          get back out there ASAP.
        </p>
        <h3>Light Bulbs</h3>
        <p>
          Light bulbs are very fragile and temperature changes tend to break
          them. We wno't wipe down or wet light bulbs.
        </p>
        <h3>Outdoors</h3>
        <p>
          For the heat, cold, and safety we aren't able to clean exterior of
          homes. This includes exterior windows, garages, porches, patios, etc.
        </p>
        <h3>Paint & Other Construction Messes</h3>
        <p>
          We <em>do</em> offer
          <span class="key">construction cleaning</span> and have equipment to
          tackle this. But for a<em> standard</em> or <em>deep clean</em>, we
          won't be cleaning paint or other construction messes. Paint, plaster,
          sheetrock dust, or other forms of construction mess is much more time
          intensive and we need to be sure we are prepared with the time, tools,
          and equipment needed. If you have this need, please reach out and we
          will provide a custom quote for your cleanup.
        </p>
        <h3>Bed Bugs & Other Insects</h3>
        <p>
          If your home has any insects, especially bed bugs, we won't be able to
          clean things up. The home needs a professional bug removal service.
          Once clear of insects, we will be able to start cleaning again.
        </p>
        <h2 class="section-subheading">Worker Safety</h2>
        <!-- <p>For the safety of our cleaners</p> -->
        <h3>Heavy Objects</h3>
        <p>
          For liability and safety, our cleaners are unable to lift more than 30
          pounds. If you require cleaning behind large furniture or appliances,
          please do your best to make accomodations beforehand
        </p>
        <h3>High Up Places</h3>
        <p>
          We use extension poles and occasionally step-stools to dust and clean,
          but due to safety and insurance, we aren't able to go higher than our
          3-step step-stool. This covers just about everything you'd need, but
          if you have extraordinary tall ceilings or cabinets, we may not be
          able to reach.
        </p>
        <h3>Biological Waste & Chemicals</h3>
        <p>
          We aren't equipped to clean any biological waste or chemicals, whether
          from pets, humans, or rodents.
