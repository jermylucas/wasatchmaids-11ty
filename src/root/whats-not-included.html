        <h3>Heavy Objects</h3>
        <p>
          For liability and safety, our cleaners are unable to lift more than 30
          pounds. If you require cleaning behind large furniture or appliances,
          please do your best to make accomodations beforehand
        </p>
        <h2 class="section-subheading">Things We Can't Clean</h2>
        <p>
          If an item is on this list, it's because of insurance coverage, worker
          safety, or that we simply don't have the equipment to do so. We will
          always do our best to help, so if you need something that's listed
          below, please reach out!
        </p>
        <p>
          Note: The cleaning type determines the nature of things we can or
          cannot clean (for example, we don't clean paint on a standard clean,
          but we can do this during a construction clean or at an additional
          charge). If you have any questions, give us a call.
        </p>
        <h3>Our Satisfaction Guarantee</h3>
        <p>
          Your Satisfaction is guaranteed. While we do not offer refunds on
          services that have been completed, we will return & re-clean any areas
          of concern that are reported to us within 24 hours of your cleaning.
          We want this to be a help for you, and we will do everything we can to
          get back out there ASAP.
