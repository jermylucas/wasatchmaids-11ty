          If you haven't already, you will soon receive an email with all the details of your cleaning. If we have any
          questions or concerns, we'll reach out to you. Otherwise, consider yourself booked! We can't wait to help out.
        </p>
        <p>
          Changes can be made to your appointment through the
          <a href="./login.html" class="key blue">login</a> page. Please, make any changes to your appointment at least
          48 hours before the scheduled time.
        </p>
        <h3>Arrival Window</h3>
        <p>
          Please allow some flexibility in your arrival time. We schedule everything with a 1 hour window, and while we
          are virtually never late, sometimes traffic, or unanticipated scope of work of other appointments require a
          later arrival. We'll let you know as soon as possible if we anticipate being late. If you require a very
          specific time, please let us know and we'll accommodate it.
        </p>
        <h3>Our Satisfaction Guarantee</h3>
        <p>
          Your Satisfaction is guaranteed. While we do not offer refunds on services that have been completed, we will
          return & re-clean any areas of concern that are reported to us within 24 hours of your cleaning. We want this
          to be a help for you, and we will do everything we can to get back out there ASAP.
        </p>
        <h3>Cancellations</h3>
        <p>
          Please give us a 48-hour heads up if you need to cancel. Our schedules are carefully made to give a living pay
          to our cleaners, and late cancellations make it very difficult to do so. We know life happens, and always are
          understanding of this. Canceling less than 48 hours before a service may result in a $70 cancellation fee.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cancellation fees may be charged for reasons outside of requesting a cancellation. For example, not being able
          to enter the home, no running water, or no electricity.
        </p>
        <p>
          In these cases, and in the case of late cancellations, we'll always try our best to find a creative solution
          to get the job done and find a client to take your spot. When we can't, or can't get in contact with the
          homeowner, we'll need to charge the $70 fee.
        </p>
        <h3>Billing</h3>
        <p>
          A hold will be placed on the account 2 business days PRIOR to the service. This gives us time to correct the
          card on file if there are no funds. If the service is canceled with a hold in place, it will drop off within
          2-5 days. Services are charged only after the service is completed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Payment to Venmo is due within 24 hours of service completion. Our Venmo account is
          <a class="key blue" href="https://account.venmo.com/u/wasatchcleaning">@WasatchCleaning</a>
        </p>
        <h3>Home Sizing and Cleaning Type</h3>
        <p>
          Please ensure that you specified your home size and the type of cleaning correctly. For accurate online
          quoting, and to understand the open spaces of the home, we do require the entire home size, with rooms we
          aren't cleaning being "excluded". To provide a high quality service, we prepare for each visit thoroughly,
          including allocating sufficient supplies and cleaners. If the house size is incorrectly specified, or we are
          prepared for general cleaning instead of move-out, we will be severely understaffed and unable to do the great
          job that you deserve.
        </p>
        <h3>Requirements</h3>
        <p>
          To guarantee service, we need <span class="key">power</span> and <span class="key">running water</span>.
          <em>During move-in/out cleanings this is especially important.</em>
          On moving cleans, we also need the place to be empty for best service. Without water, power, or space to
          clean, we can't guarantee the high quality of service.
        </p>
        <h3>Services We Don't Offer</h3>
        <p>
          There is a small list of things we cannot clean. This includes items like biological waste,
          remediation/restoration, garages, or high up places. A complete list can be found on our
          <a
