      <h2>A Service You'll Love</h2>
      <p>
        We know that a lot goes into picking a great house cleaner. Because of our commitment to excellence, we can only
        afford the best cleaners. Wasatch Maids employs a small team of experienced cleaners, and goes through
        consistent and regular training will all of them. In result, you get the same
        <span class="key">effective, friendly, honest, and thorough</span> cleaning experience every time we come out to
        your home.
      </p>
      <h2>Safe Cleaning Products for Your Family</h2>
      <p>
        Cleaning products often contain harsh or dangerous chemicals. Through our years of cleaning, we have tried and
        tested all sorts of products in order to find the safest yet still effective products. Through this, we landed
        on using an all-purpost cleaner that is <span class="key blue">eco-friendly</span>, safe, and non-toxic. It is
        even USDA A-1 rated for use around food. That means our cleaning is safe for your family, safe for your kids,
        and safe for your pets.
      </p>
      <h3>Employees, Not Contractors</h3>
      <p>
        The majority of cleaning companies use independent contractors who complete cleaning on behalf of the company.
        This usually means a little bit less overhead and taxe burden for the owning company. However, at Wasatch Maids,
        we use employees instead. Unlike contractors, employees have the same onboarding and training, and they
        understand the company culture and overall values. This translates to reliability and consistency for you. If a
        cleaner for some reason cannot make it out, we have multiple back-ups, including the co-owners, who all have
        many years of cleaning experience. And while we do have some overhead like our
        <span class="key">2 million dollar insurance policy</span> to keep your home or business protected, we are also
        able to be much more competitive with our prices than companies that end up contracting out all the work.
