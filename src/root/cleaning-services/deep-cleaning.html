          Many people have different definitions of "deep cleaning." All our
          cleaners are professionally certified maids, and we find that due to
          our expertise and attention to detail, a standard clean covers more
          than all other Utah maids
          <em>
            (did you know that we even clean baseboards during
            <a href="/cleaning-services/house-cleaning.html" class="blue-link">
              standard cleaning services? </a
            >).
          </em>
          Still, you may find that you want a little bit more elbow grease in a
          specific area, or maybe it's been a while since your home has had a
          good clean. Our goal with our deep cleaning services is to spend extra
          time on the items that only need a cleaning every 6-12 months. For
          Wasatch Maids, a deep cleaning is everything in the
          <a href="/home-cleaning-checklist.html" class="blue-link"

          >, plus wet-wiping blinds, doors, light switches, AC vents, and power
          outlets.

          These extra details are designed to get your home looking as good as
          possible. Deep cleaning is sometimes called spring cleaning or detail
          cleaning.

          Deep cleaning is a great opportunity to look at adding extras like
          interior windows, cleaning inside the fridge and/or oven, and spot
          cleaning walls.
