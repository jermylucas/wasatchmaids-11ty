          Many people have different definitions of a move-in / move-out
          cleaning. Our moving cleans include everything in the standard and
          deep cleanings, plus many other considerations to make sure the
          residence is perfect for you, or the next family. Our professionally
          certified cleaners are extremely thorough and put in the extra work to
          make your home look new again. Still, you may find that you want a
          little bit more elbow grease in a specific area, or maybe it's been a
          while since your home has had a good clean. Our goal with our deep
          cleaning services is to spend extra time on the items that only need a
          cleaning every 6-12 months. For Wasatch Maids, a deep cleaning is
          everything in the
          <a href="/home-cleaning-checklist.html" class="blue-link"
            >standard cleaning</a
          >, plus wet-wiping blinds, doors, light switches, AC vents, and power
          outlets.

          These extra details are designed to get your home looking as good as
          possible. Deep cleaning is sometimes called spring cleaning or detail
          cleaning.

          Deep cleaning is a great opportunity to look at adding extras like
          interior windows, cleaning inside the fridge and/or oven, and spot
          cleaning walls.
