        <h3>Why get a move-in/move-out clean?</h3>
        <p>
          A move-in/move-out cleaning is perfect for an empty home to make sure
          the residence is ready for the next family. Whether that next family
          is a renter, someone who just bought the home, or even you, getting a
          home cleaned while it's empty is perfect so you don't have to live in
          the previous owner's dust, and so you can get all those walls,
          cupboards, and appliances cleaned before putting your own stuff there.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="text-content">
        <p>
          When cleaning in an empty home, there are exposed walls, baseboards,
          and cupboards that are not usually available for standard cleanings.
          Once you unpack and finish moving, these areas may not be cleaned
          again for a long time. By trusting Wasatch Maids to do the
          <span class="key">move-in / move-out clean</span> for you, then you
          can guarantee everything will be placed in a clean home.

          There are only a few, but still some things our moving cleans can't
          cover. This is due to insurance and equipment restrictions. If you
          have any of these requests, call or text us and we can get you in
          touch with a trusted professional.

            <li>
              Professionally cleaning of carpets (we thoroughly vacuum, but
              can't remove stains)
            </li>
            <li>
              Grout & tile cleaning (again, we thoroughly clean, but grout and
              tile may require additional work for stain removal)

          Our cleans include everything you can expect for an empty home and
          these items are <em>included by default</em>. Still, if you would like
          to <span class="key">exclude any extras</span>, you can easily do so
          while booking online, or over the phone.
