        <h2>New Home & Post Construction Cleaning Services</h2>
        <p>
          Wasatch Maids is one of the
          <span class="key">top-rated</span> cleaning services in Northern Utah. And while we are best known for our
          house cleaning, we offer new home and post-construction as well. This means that our highly rated service and
          <span class="key blue">complete satisfaction guarantee</span> covers your new home or construction too!
        </p>
        <h2>Why Choose Wasatch Maids?</h2>
        <p>
          A contractor may do a general cleaning of debris, but a detailed cleaning is not part of the job. New
          construction homes and apartments are beautifully made, but may not have a detailed cleaning to finish it up.
          This is where Wasatch Maids comes in. We often hear about the amount of dust and mess left behind by the
          construction crew; this impedes you from moving in.
        </p>
        <p>
          You deserve to be able to live in the home as soon as possible, and not dealing with the dust, putty, and
          other debris. That is why Wasatch Maids offers Post Construction cleaning services, so you do not have to
          worry about both moving everything into the home, and getting everything clean. We will take care of the
          cleaning so you can move into your new home as soon as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our <span class="key">complete satisfaction guarantee</span> covers our post construction cleaning. If
          something is not done to your liking, or if we can do something a little bit different, we can immediately
          take care of the issue and it will be noticeable right away. If a cleaner for some reason cannot make it out,
          we have multiple back-ups, including the co-owners, who all have years of cleaning experience. And while we do
          have overhead like our <span class="key">2 million dollar insurance policy</span> to keep your home or
          business protected, we are also able to be competitive with companies that end up contracting out all the
          work, and best of all, you get the most quality for your money.
        </p>
        <h3>Professional Cleaners, Not Construction Workers</h3>
        <p>
          Construction workers, are just that, trained in construction. They may construct a beautifully designed home,
          yet, they lack the training to really make a home professional. Our cleaners are professionally trained to
          specifically make the home shine.
        </p>
        <p>
          All of this means the
          <span class="key blue">highest quality</span> of cleaning, <span class="key blue"> best communication</span> ,
          and <span class="key blue">more money</span> in your pocket. Construction projects can be messy, so let us
          take care of the mess so you can focus on the other important things.
