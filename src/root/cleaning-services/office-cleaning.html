        <h2>Office Cleaning & Janitorial Services</h2>
        <p>
          Wasatch Maids is one of the
          <span class="key">top-rated</span> cleaning services in Northern Utah.
          And while we are best known for our house cleaning, we offer
          commercial and office cleanings as well. This means that our highly
          rated service and
          <span class="key blue">complete satisfaction guarantee</span> covers
          your business too!
        </p>
        <h2>Why Choose Wasatch Maids?</h2>
        <p>
          One of the most common things we hear when it comes to office
          cleaning, is that businesses feel they are paying too much for the
          quality they are receiving. Most commercial and office cleanings are
          franchises, or large corporations where quality control becomes
          difficult. It can also be nerve-wracking to change a cleaning service,
          and adjust schedules. In the end, businesses just "put up" with the
          service.
        </p>
        <p>
          You and your workplace <em>deserve better than this.</em> That's why
          Wasatch Maids offers janitorial services / office cleanings. You don't
          have to worry about jumping "through the hoops" just to get some
          information across. Our cleaners have gone through unique training
          specific to all types of offices. We care about your business looks so
          you can continue gaining those customers and keeping employees happy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our <span class="key">complete satisfaction guarantee</span> covers
          our office cleanings too. If something isn't done to the liking of any
          person in the company, or even if we can do something a little bit
          different, we can immediately take care of the issue and it will be
          noticeable right away.
        </p>
        <h3>Employees, Not Contractors</h3>
        <p>
          Many cleaning companies use contractors who complete the work on
          behalf of the company. However, at Wasatch Maids, we use employees
          instead. Unlike contractors, employees have the same onboarding and
          training, and they understand the company culture and overall values.
          This translates to reliability for you. If a cleaner for some reason
          cannot make it out, we have multiple back-ups, including the
          co-owners, who all have years of cleaning experience. And while we do
          have overhead like our
          <span class="key">2 million dollar insurance policy</span> to keep
          your business protected, we are also able to be much more competitive
          with our prices than companies that end up contracting out all the
          work.
        </p>
        <p>
          All of this means the
          <span class="key blue">highest quality</span> of cleaning,
          <span class="key blue"> increased communication</span> with your
          cleaning company, and <span class="key blue">more money</span> in your
          pocket. We know what it's like to run a business, and that's why we
          want nothing but the best for yours. We believe that this starts by
          having a clean space for customers and employees.
