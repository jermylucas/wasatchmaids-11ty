<h2><a href="/cleaning-services/move-in-move-out-cleaning" class="black-link">Move-In / Move-Out Cleaning</a></h2>

Moving isn't easy, and it's made even more difficult when you need to clean after all the moving is done. Still, the final house cleaning is a vital step between home transitions.

A move-in/move-out clean is a much more thorough cleaning where we go inside empty drawers, clean walls, oven, fridge, interior windows, and more -- in addition to our already thorough home cleaning. And it is one of the most popular services we offer.

Let Wasatch Maids take care of the cleaning, so you can focus on getting settled into the new place.

<h2><a href="/cleaning-services/office-cleaning.html" class="black-link">Commercial & Office Cleaning</a></h2>

One of the most common complaints we hear from businesses, is that they feel they are paying too much for the quality they are receiving. Most commercial and office cleanings are franchises, or large corporations where quality control becomes difficult. Even using smaller cleaning companies or individuals, the service may suffer due to quality control and lack of training. But in the end, businesses just "put up" with the service.

You and your workplace <em>deserve better than this.</em> That's why Wasatch Maids offers commercial and office cleaning / janitorial services throughout Ogden Valley. Whether your business is in Huntsville, near the ski resorts, or anywhere in the valley, you don't have to worry about jumping "through the hoops" just to get some information across.

<h2><a href="/cleaning-services/post-construction-cleaning.html" class="black-link">New Home & Post Construction Cleaning</a></h2>

Cleaning up after a large construction job is no easy task. Dried plaster, dust everywhere, and no idea where to start. Wasatch Maids does post-construction cleaning in the Ogden Valley area, and other service locations.

A contractor may do a general cleaning of debris, but a detailed cleaning is not part of the job. New construction homes and apartments are beautifully made, but may not have a detailed cleaning to finish it up. This is where Wasatch Maids comes in. We often hear about the amount of dust and mess left behind by the construction crew; this impedes you from moving in. Get in touch and see how we can help!

### Employees, Not Contractors

Many cleaning companies use contractors who complete the work on behalf of the company. However, at Wasatch Maids, we use employees instead. Unlike contractors, employees have the same onboarding and training, and they understand the company culture and overall values. This translates to reliability for you. If a cleaner for some reason cannot make it out, we have multiple back-ups, including the co-owners, who all have years of cleaning experience. And while we do have overhead like our <span class="key">2 million dollar insurance policy</span> to keep your home or business protected, we are also able to be much more competitive with our prices than companies that end up contracting out all the work.

All of this means the <span class="key blue">highest quality</span> of cleaning,
<span class="key blue"> increased communication</span> with your
cleaning company, and <span class="key blue">more money</span> in your
pocket. We know what it's like to run a business in Ogden, and that's
why we want nothing but the best for yours. We believe that this
starts by having a clean space for customers and employees.
