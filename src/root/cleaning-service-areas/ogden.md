## Cleaning Services in Ogden, Utah

We know it's not easy picking a maid service or cleaning company. Wasatch Maids has a dedicated team of professionals to clean your home, office, or construction project. Whether you're by Weber State, in North Ogden, South Ogden, or anything in between, Wasatch Maids provides home cleaning and maid services near you.

## House Cleaning & Maid Services

We interview hundreds of maids and house cleaners, always looking for the best ones who believe in our core values of being <span class="key">clean, honest, thorough, and fair</span>. It isn't easy, but we've found them, and they are cleaning in Ogden, Utah.

All services including the standard home cleaning, move-in / move-out, deep spring cleaning, post construction cleaning, and office cleaning are backed by our <span class="key blue">complete satisfaction guarantee</span>. We are 100% committed to our work and delivering the quality you deserve. Wasatch Maids is locally owned business out of Ogden. We care about our community and would never do anything to harm our reputation here. If you want your home, construction project, or office cleaned with the same love and care you give to it, Wasatch Maids is the company for you.

## Commercial & Office Cleaning

One of the most common complaints we hear from businesses, is that they feel they are paying too much for the quality they are receiving. Most commercial and office cleanings are franchises, or large corporations where quality control becomes difficult. Even using smaller cleaning companies or individuals, the service may suffer due to quality control and lack of training. But in the end, businesses just "put up" with the service.

You and your workplace <em>deserve better than this.</em> That's why Wasatch Maids offers commercial and office cleaning / janitorial services in the Ogden area. You don't have to worry about jumping "through the hoops" just to get some information across. Our cleaners have gone through unique training specific to all types of offices, and we are based in central Ogden, and are active participants in the community. We care about how Ogden city looks, and especially how your home or business interior looks to keep gaining those customers and keeping employees happy.

Our <span class="key">complete satisfaction guarantee</span> covers our office cleanings too. If something isnâ€™t done to the liking of any person in the company, or even if we can do something a little bit different, we can immediately take care of the issue and it will be noticeable right away.

### Employees, Not Contractors

Many cleaning companies use contractors who complete the work on behalf of the company. However, at Wasatch Maids, we use employees instead. Unlike contractors, employees have the same onboarding and training, and they understand the company culture and overall values. This translates to reliability for you. If a cleaner for some reason cannot make it out, we have multiple back-ups, including the co-owners, who all have years of cleaning experience. And while we do have overhead like our <span class="key">2 million dollar insurance policy</span> to keep your home or business protected, we are also able to be much more competitive with our prices than companies that end up contracting out all the work.

All of this means the <span class="key blue">highest quality</span> of cleaning,
<span class="key blue"> increased communication</span> with your
cleaning company, and <span class="key blue">more money</span> in your
pocket. We know what it's like to run a business in Ogden, and that's
why we want nothing but the best for yours. We believe that this
starts by having a clean space for customers and employees.
