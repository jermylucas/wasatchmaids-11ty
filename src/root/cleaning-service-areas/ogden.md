## Commercial & Office Cleaning

One of the most common things we hear when it comes to office cleaning, is that businesses feel they are paying too much for the quality they are receiving. Most commercial and office cleanings are franchises, or large corporations where quality control becomes difficult. It can also be nerve-wracking to change a cleaning service, and adjust schedules. In the end, businesses just "put up" with the service.

We know you and your workplace deserve better than this. That's why Wasatch Maids offers commercial and office cleaning in the Ogden area. We are based in central Ogden, and are active participants in the community. We care about how Ogden city looks, and especially how your business interior looks to keep gaining those customers and keeping employees happy.

### Employees, Not Contractors

Many cleaning companies use contractors who complete the work on behalf of the company. However, at Wasatch Maids, we use employees instead. Unlike contractors, employees are onboarded to all have the same training, and they understand the company culture and overall values. This means that when we clean your business, you don't need to worry about changes in quality or last minute schedule changes. And while we do have some additional overhead like our <span class="key">2 million dollar insurance policy</span> to keep your business protected, we are also able to be much more competitive with our prices than companies that end up contracting out all the work.

All this results in the <span class="key blue">highest quality</span> of cleaning, increased communication with the cleaning company, and more money in your pocket. We know what it's like to run a business in Ogden, and that's why we want nothing but the best for yours. We believe that this starts by having a clean space for customers and employees.
