          <p>
            <em>Last Updated February 24, 2022</em>
          </p>
          <h3 class="policy-heading">Policy Terms</h3>
          <p>
            This Service Policy constitute a legally binding agreement (the
            “Agreement”) between you and Rocky Mountain Group LLC, DBA Wasatch
            Maids ("Wasatch Maids", "we", “us”, or “our”) that governs your
            access or use of the applications, websites, content, products, and
            services (collectively, the “Wasatch Maids Services”) made available
            by Wasatch Maids.
          </p>
          <p>
            Any persons (whether individual, company, or entity) hereby referred
            to as a you, user, customer, and/or client who books a service with
            Wasatch Maids, in any way including but not limited to over the
            website, email, phone call, text message, or in-person is agreeing
            to the terms set forth by this document.
          </p>
          <p>
            By entering into to this Agreement, you expressly acknowledge that
            you understand this Agreement and accept all of its terms. If you do
            not agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this agreement,

          </p>
          <h3 class="policy-heading">Initial Home Cleanings</h3>
          <p>
            All new clients of recurring cleaning services must have a single
            cleaning completed before recurring cleanings will begin. This is
            charged at a one-time rate. All first initial cleans will be
            followed by recurring weekly, bi weekly, or monthly cleanings. A
            recurring service is defined as a service performed within 30 days
            of the previous service. If service is provided outside of 30 days,
            it may be subject to the one-time rate.
          </p>
          <p>
            First-time cleanings typically take longer than the maintenance
            cleans and time is always estimated to be longer than the recurring
            cleans. The work is involved to bring the home to standard and
            prepare it for discounted recurring cleanings (as these normally
            take less time). All cleaning for initial and recurring cleanings
            have areas cleaned as provided on our website:
            <a href="/home-cleaning-checklist.html" target="_blank"
              >wasatchmaids.com/home-cleaning-checklist</a
            >
          </p>
          <h3 class="policy-heading">Payment Methods and Terms</h3>
          <p>
            As a customer, you are entitled to a no-hassle buying experience. We
            accept checks, Credit Card, Venmo, and cash. Credit Card payment is
            subject to a temporary hold 48 hours prior to service, and is
            charged upon completion at the total, or adjusted amount. All other
            payments required upon completion of service within 24 hours or as
            otherwise agreed upon. All checks are to be written out to Wasatch
            Maids, or Rocky Mountain Group. Your Satisfaction is guaranteed.
            While we do not offer refunds on services that have been provided,
            we will return & re-clean any areas of concern that are reported to
            us within 24 hours of your cleaning. If a re-clean request is not
            accepted, we are unable to provide any refunds or price reductions.
            Any price reduction from original service is done out of the
            kindness of Wasatch Maids and is not part of our policy.
          </p>
          <h3 class="policy-heading">
            Recurring Home Cleanings: (weekly, bi weekly, monthly cleanings)
          </h3>
          <p>
            The rate to clean your home will depend on the square footage of
            your home and how often you need cleaning. The rate is also
            determined by how your home is lived in. (Animals, Children, etc.).
          </p>
          <p>
            Due to insurance requirements, we are not allowed to be on any
            ladders other than our provided ones and step-stool (as these are a
            pre-determined height according to our insurance). We are also not
            able to move heavy furniture in order to clean behind, and ask that
            you may do so before we arrive, otherwise we may not be able to
            clean the needed areas.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although we are professionals, sometimes we are called in too late
            to correct damage that is already done to surfaces that were not
            taken care of in the past. Other items may take a couple of
            cleanings to look their very best (even after a deep clean). We
            strive in making everything look as new as possible. In cases of
            extremely cluttered areas or surfaces we reserve the right to use
            our discretion to skip those areas to avoid damaging items or
            hurting ourselves. We also reserve the right to skip a cleaning or
            area in the home which isn't part of the original scope, as outlined
            on Wasatch Maids' What's Not Included page.
          </p>
          <p>
            We need to be able to work freely and without distractions. Every
            effort is made to work safely and cautiously, but we cannot If for
            any reason an employee of Wasatch Maids feels that their personal
            safety is in danger enough to leave the job site, due to actions by
            the customer, guests of the customers or others at the job site, the
            customer will remain liable for the full cost of the job.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Special Requests</strong> - We do ask that you have all
            special requests in advance to assure that your cleaning team who is
            responsible for cleaning several homes each working day, will be
            able to accommodate your special requests without impacting our
            other clients' needs for arrival times, etc. If special requests are
            added that are outside of original scope, prices will be adjusted
            based on our standard rates.
          </p>
          <p>
            We provide all the appropriate equipment and supplies necessary to
            do our jobs. Any additional service requests by yourself not
            included in the cleaning package that you select will also be billed
            for additionally unless it is noted on your service proposal at the
            time of your estimate, or booking. (for example - refrigerator
            cleaning, oven cleaning, etc.) For your convenience we do have an
            invoicing and auto-pay program. All services are invoiced, and
            payment is due upon completion of your recurring service.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Communication</strong> - We love to hear from you! Please
            reach out to us, leave notes, or call us to let us know how we are
            doing. Notes are also great to give specific cleaning instructions,
            and to let us know an area that may have been overlooked. Do not
            hesitate to let us know any concern, we want you to be happy. I
            appreciate all comments regarding service and will use them to
            improve all aspects of residential cleanings.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Cancellation Policies</strong> - Every client has a
            designated spot on the calendar for their services. If you have any
            changes, please call/text us as soon as possible (801) 821-2316.
            This allows us to plan and make any adjustments needed. With respect
            to our time and other clients' schedules and requests, we have a
            48-hour cancellation policy unless agreed upon prior to performing
            the clean. Last minute cancellations can cause havoc on our
            scheduling. You may reschedule, skip, add, or cancel any of your
            cleanings, however we do ask for a 48-hour notice for these actions.
            Cancellations happening with less than a 48-hour notice will be
            charged at $50 cancellation fee. Payment will have to be made in
            full prior to scheduling any further work. All cancellations must be
            made through the owner of the company by calling (801) 821-2316.
            Please understand that unlike other industries such as retail, hair
            dressers, etc. we in the cleaning industry do not have the luxury of
            walk-in customers to supplement our schedules when a client cancels
            without notice. When we schedule your cleaning service, we reserve
            that space/ time for you and you alone. Cancellations cost us dearly
            and it is why we need policies in place. We thank you in advance for
            your understanding. We strive to deliver your service in a timely
            manner. We service homes between the hours of 9:00 am and 5:00 pm.
            Even if you normally have an afternoon cleaning, there may be times
            that we need to clean your home in the am instead. Approximate time
            of arrival will be provided upon scheduling and booking. We make
            every attempt to pin our arrival time estimate down to a 1-hour
            window of time based on that day's work load.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Health Matters</strong> - We ask that you notify our office
            if you or anyone in your family is sick or has a contagious illness
            so that we can take precautions or choose to re-schedule your job.
            We will also never send one of our team members into your home if we
            know that they are ill. Please note that due to health reasons we do
            not clean up pet waste or other bio-hazard cleaning, as these are
            different services.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Vacations and Holidays</strong> - Wasatch Maids is closed on
            New Year's Even, New Year's Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day,
            Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. If
            your regular cleaning lands on one of these days, we will reschedule
            you to another day. Weekly clients will have first choice of
            rescheduled dates, then bi-weekly, then monthly. If you will be out
            of town or on vacation during a holiday week, please let our office
            know as soon as possible to avoid a last-minute cancellation fee.

            any nature from a customer's home. Even gifts may not be accepted
            unless in writing. This is done for your protection as well as ours.
            If anything appears to be taken from a customer's home, it must be
            reported with our office. A police report will be filed and the
            employee will be terminated. The cost will be recuperated after
            investigation if Wasatch Maids is found at fault. Please be advised
            that we assume no liability for damage or loss of items that are not
            secured property or that were damaged prior to our cleaning.
