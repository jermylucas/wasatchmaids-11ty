        Today, Wasatch Maids sent three amazing women to my home. These women
        worked. Non stop. For four hours doing the best deep clean I've ever
        seen. I am thrilled with the way they left my house. They were on time,
        friendly, yet completely focused on the work. My house literally
        sparkles and I can't say enough good things about them. If I could give
        them ten stars, I absolutely would. Thank you Wasatch Maids. I wish I
        had tried you years ago.

        I have used these guys for quite a few years. They are amazing. As a
        Realtor I use them to get homes ready for pictures, move out cleaning,
        getting a client ready for move in, and in my own home. Never
        disappointed!

        This company is exceptional! From the moment I first contacted them,
        they responded promptly to my questions. They arrived at our house for a
        move out cleaning. Our house is an older home with 5 bedrooms, 2 baths
        and an unfinished basement. Quite a job. It took longer than expected
        but he stuck to the quote he gave. My family is very impressed with the
        company and the job they did. I wish I could give them more than the 5
        stars! Thank you Wasatch Maids!!
