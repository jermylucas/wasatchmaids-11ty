        Today, Wasatch Maids sent three amazing women to my home. These women worked. Non stop. For four hours doing the
        best deep clean I've ever seen. I am thrilled with the way they left my house. They were on time, friendly, yet
        completely focused on the work. My house literally sparkles and I can't say enough good things about them. If I
        could give them ten stars, I absolutely would. Thank you Wasatch Maids. I wish I had tried you years ago.

        I have used these guys for quite a few years. They are amazing. As a Realtor I use them to get homes ready for
        pictures, move out cleaning, getting a client ready for move in, and in my own home. Never disappointed!

        This company is exceptional! From the moment I first contacted them, they responded promptly to my questions.
        They arrived at our house for a move out cleaning. Our house is an older home with 5 bedrooms, 2 baths and an
        unfinished basement. Quite a job. It took longer than expected but he stuck to the quote he gave. My family is
        very impressed with the company and the job they did. I wish I could give them more than the 5 stars! Thank you
        Wasatch Maids!!

        We are always very pleased with the thorough way our home is cleaned on a weekly basis. They are always on time,
        professional and pleasant. Itâ€™s easy to communicate, and receive timely assistance in scheduling. I highly
        recommend working with Wasatch Maids!

        What a great service! We wanted to thoroughly clean our home before our baby was born, and Guadalupe and Julia
        went above and beyond. They cleaned behind and below the couches and baby bassinet. They even got the inside of
        the oven cleaner than we've ever managed. They did all we asked and more. Highly recommend!
